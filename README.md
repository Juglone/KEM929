# KEM929 Bachelor's Thesis

In this repository you can see the data from the camera recordings of the gel in different media, compression tests and swelling tests.
In the `camera_recording_timelapse`-folder you can find the timelapse-script
(`ffmpeg_every200th.sh`) for making
the 10-hour recordings into ~3 minute-timelapses. The timelapse-videos can be found in
`august_old_setup`, `july_old_setup` and `new_setup`-folders. The `new_setup` folder is the one
I'm doing data analysis on.
